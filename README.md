# MyCareerExplorer

It is a web application providing real-time labor market information (RT-LMI) along with visualization such that it facilitates career exploration of students in Nepal. 
Some of the major deliverables of the web application are;

a) Job’s Information, 
b) Trend Graph, 
c) Career Comparison, 
d) Opportunity Map and 
e) Business’ Information. 

The system automatically scrapes job portals every Sunday through puppeteer and node cron. 
The scraped data then gets stored in MongoDB and later used for data analysis and visualization through D3.js.
