# MyCareerExplorer

It is a web application providing labor market information along with visualization such that it facilitates career exploration of students in Nepal. 
Some of the major deliverables of the web application are;

* Job’s Information, 
* Trend Graph, 
* Career Comparison, 
* Opportunity Map and 
* Business’ Information. 

The system gets the data by automatically scraping a Nepali job portal every Sunday through puppeteer and node cron. 
The scraped data then gets stored in MongoDB and later used for data analysis and visualization through D3.js.
